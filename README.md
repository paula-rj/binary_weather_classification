## Overview
This work deals with a binary (two classes) classification of images problem. The dataset is made up of images of outdoors under two different kinds of weather: sunny or cloudy. In other words, the problem is detecting if the image represents a sunny or cloudy weather, with images taken from the ground (not satellite imagery). The image may be a photo of a landscape, a city, a person, etc. and may contain lots of different objects in it. The whole code is in a Jupyter notebook. It's written in Python; Pythorch library is used. 

## Dataset
The dataset is hosted in Kaggle, it contains of two folders:
* The train (training) folder: contains 'sunny' and 'cloudy' folders, each one has 5000 RGB jpg images.
* The test folder: contains 'sunny' and 'cloudy' folders, with 153 and 100 RGB jpg images respectively.
